# Netlify Redirect Parser

Parses redirect rules from both `_redirects` and `netlify.toml` and normalizes them to an array of objects.

For most users, you are not meant to use this directly, please refer to https://github.com/netlify/cli instead. However
if you are debugging issues with redirect parsing, issues and PRs are welcome.
