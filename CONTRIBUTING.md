This project was made with ❤️. The simplest way to give back is by starring and sharing it online.

Everyone is welcome regardless of personal background. We enforce a [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in order to
promote a positive and inclusive environment.

## Development process

First fork and clone the repository. If you're not sure how to do this, please watch
[these videos](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Run:

```bash
npm install
```

Tests are run with:

```bash
npm test
```

Make sure everything is correctly setup by running those tests first.

ESLint and Prettier are performed automatically on `git push`. However, we recommend you setup your IDE or text editor
to run ESLint and Prettier automatically on file save. Otherwise, you should run them manually using:

```bash
npm run format
```

Alternatively you can setup your IDE to integrate with Prettier and ESLint for JavaScript and Markdown files.

This is a monorepo using [npm 7 (or later) workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces). You can find
the included packages in the [packages](packages) directory.

## Testing

See our [testing documentation](packages/build/tests/README.md) to learn about our integration tests setup.

After submitting the pull request, please make sure the Continuous Integration checks (GitHub actions) are passing.

## Releasing

To release a specific package:

1. Merge the relevant package release PR created by `release-please`
2. Run `npm publish packages/packageName`

Linting and tests will automatically run before publish.

Packages dependencies graph:

```
@netlify/zip-it-and-ship-it -> js-client
                            -> @netlify/function-utils
                            -> @netlify/build
                            -> netlify-cli
js-client                   -> @netlify/config
                            -> netlify-cli
any @netlify/*-utils        -> @netlify/build
@netlify/config             -> @netlify/build
                            -> netlify-cli
                            -> buildbot
@netlify/build              -> netlify-cli
                            -> buildbot
build-image                 -> buildbot
netlify/plugins             -> buildbot
@netlify/framework-info     -> buildbot
                            -> netlify-cli
```

Note that Renovate should take care of opening PRs to update the relevant packages that depend upon the modules you just
published. However, to make good use of your time, make sure to follow the dependency graph above. I.e.
`@netlify/config` is a dependency of `@netlify/build`, so if you've just updated the former you should first start by
updating `@netlify/build` and let Renovate bundle those two changes together when updating buildbot.

### Buildbot

When `@netlify/build` or `@netlify/config` is published to npm, Renovate will automatically create a release PR in the
buildbot after a short while. Once the Jenkins build has passed and finished building, the PR can be tested in
production by updating the `Site.build_image` property of any test Site. This can be done with the following Netlify CLI
commands:

```bash
netlify api updateSite --data='{ "site_id": "{{siteId}}", "body": { "build_image": "{{buildImage}}" }}'
```

The `{{buildImage}}` can be the buildbot commit hash or `git` branch name.

## Beta release

To test a beta release of `@netlify/build` in a site:

- Make a prerelease: `npm version prerelease`
- Publish on npm using a `beta` tag: `npm publish --tag=beta`
- Make a PR in the buildbot to use this prerelease
- Update the `build_image` of a site to use this PR

This is especially useful to test how an ongoing PR in `@netlify/build` would behave in production.
