This project was made with ❤️. The simplest way to give back is by starring and sharing it online.

Everyone is welcome regardless of personal background. We enforce a [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in order to
promote a positive and inclusive environment.

## Development process

First fork and clone the repository. If you're not sure how to do this, please watch
[these videos](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Run:

```bash
npm install
```

Make sure everything is correctly setup with:

```bash
npm test
```

Linting and prettification is performed automatically on `git push`. However you should run them before any `git commit`
using:

```bash
npm run format
```

Alternatively you can setup your IDE to integrate with Prettier and ESLint for JavaScript and Markdown files.

This is a monorepo. You can find the included packages in the [packages](packages) directory.

## Testing

See our [testing documentation](packages/build/tests/README.md) to learn about our integration tests setup.

After submitting the pull request, please make sure the Continuous Integration checks (GitHub actions) are passing.

## Releasing

To release a specific package:

```bash
# On the root directory.
# Do not release if linting or tests are failing. This might indicate a bug.
$ npm test

# Go inside the package directory
$ cd packages/packageName

# Replace "patch" with "minor" or "major" or "prerelease" depending on the case
$ npm version patch
$ git add -p
$ git commit

$ npm publish
```

If a package is released, the other packages that depend on it should increment their version of that package inside
their own `package.json`, and a new release of them should be made. This means releasing one package usually ends up
releasing all upstream packages in order.

```
@netlify/zip-it-and-ship-it -> js-client
                            -> @netlify/function-utils
                            -> @netlify/build
                            -> @netlify/cli
js-client                   -> @netlify/config
                            -> @netlify/cli
any @netlify/*-utils        -> @netlify/build
@netlify/config             -> @netlify/build
                            -> @netlify/cli
                            -> buildbot
@netlify/build              -> @netlify/cli
                            -> buildbot
build-image                 -> buildbot
netlify/plugins             -> buildbot
```

To upgrade Netlify Build in the buildbot, a PR must be created that increments the version of `@netlify/build` and
`@netlify/cli`. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/netlify/buildbot/pull/852). Once the Jenkins build has
passed and finished building, the PR can be tested in production by updating the `Site.build_image` property of any test
Site. This can be done with the following Netlify CLI commands:

```bash
netlify api updateSite --data='{ "site_id": "{{siteId}}", "body": { "build_image": "{{buildImage}}" }}'
```

The `{{buildImage}}` can be the buildbot commit hash or `git` branch name.

## Beta release

To test a beta release of `@netlify/build` in a site:

- Make a prerelease: `npm version prerelease`
- Publish on npm using a `beta` tag: `npm publish --tag=beta`
- Make a PR in the buildbot to use this prerelease
- Update the `build_image` of a site to use this PR

This is especially useful to test how an ongoing PR in `@netlify/build` would behave in production.
