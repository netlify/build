## Background

During a site build, there are a variety of things happening under the hood.

This is a simplified view of a typical build life cycle:

1. Netlify clones your repo & looks for diffs
2. Dependencies are install in the project
3. We run your build command
4. Files & dependencies are cached
5. Finally, your site is deployed to the web!

Historically, when connecting your site to Netlify, we ask for the build command (step 3 above) and will run through
this build process. This works great for most use cases & will continue to do so 😃

For builds that require a little more flexibility, we are introducing **Netlify Build** as programatic interface on top
of these build events to allow users to customize this flow.

**Netlify Build** is designed to support any kind of build flow and is extendable to fit any unique project
requirements.

## How it works

Builds are controlled by a series of [lifecycle](#lifecycle) events that `plugins` and Netlify config files can hook
into.

**The [build lifecycle](#lifecycle) can be extended in two ways:**

1. Adding lifecycle commands to `build.lifecycle` in your [config file](#extending-via-config)
2. Installing pre-packaged [plugins](#plugins)

Let's examine each.

### 1. Extending via config

Inside the netlify config file, you can attach [lifecycle](#lifecycle) commands to a new property `build.lifecycle`.

```yml
build:
  publish: my-dist-folder
  # Run this lifecycle during build
  lifecycle:
    onInit:
      - npm run thing
      - echo "much wow"
    onPreBuild: curl download-static-content
    onBuild: npm run build
    onPostBuild:
      - npx generate-sitemap
```

### 2. Extending via plugins

[Netlify Plugins](#plugins) are installable packages that extend the functionality of the netlify build process.

They can be installed from `npm` or run locally from relative path in your project.

```yml
# Config file `plugins` defines plugins used by build.
plugins:
  - package: ./local/path/to/plugin-folder
    config:
      optionOne: 'hello'
      optionTwo: 'there'
 - package: plugin-from-npm
   config:
     optionOne: 'neat'
     arrayOfValues:
      - david@netlify.com
      - jim@netlify.com
```

Netlify plugins can be found on npm by
[searching for `keywords:netlify-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Anetlify-plugin) or in the
[plugin directory](https://github.com/netlify/plugins#community-plugins).

## Build Lifecycle

The build process runs through a series of lifecycle events. These events are the places we can extend how the Netlify
build operates.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END (LIFECYCLE_TABLE) -->

The Lifecycle flows the events in order and executes and their `onPre` & `onPost` counterparts.

`onPre` happens before a specific event.

`onPost` happens after a specific event.

```

## Netlify Configuration

Below you will see 2 new values for Netlify configuration. `build.lifecycle` & `plugins`.

`build.lifecycle` is where you can define inline commands to run during the different stages of the build lifecycle.

`plugins` is an array of build plugins to run during the build process. These run in the order in which they are
defined.

**Example:**

```yml
# Inline `build.lifecycle` commands can be defined
build:
  functions: src/functions
  publish: build
  lifecycle:
    onInit:
      - npm run foo
      - export VALUE=lol
      - echo "much wow"
    onGetCache:
      - echo 'curl custom cache'
    onBuild: |
      echo 'Hello Netlify Build!'
      npm run build

# Config file `plugins` defines plugins used by build. Plugins are optional
plugins:
  - package: ./local/path/to/plugin-folder
    config:
      optionOne: hello
      optionTwo: there
  - package: plugin-from-npm
    config:
      optionOne: neat
      arrayOfValues:
        - david@netlify.com
        - jim@netlify.com
```

Configuration can be written in `toml`, `yml` or `json`.

## Plugins

Netlify Plugins extend the functionality of the netlify build process.

Plugins are plain JavaScript objects with event handlers for the different events happening during builds.

For example, the `onPreBuild` event handler runs before your build command. Or the `onPostBuild` event handler runs
after your site build has completed.

Here is an example:

```js
// ./node_modules/netlify-plugin-awesome/index.js

module.exports = {
  name: 'netlify-plugin-awesome',
  onInit: () => {
    console.log('Run custom logic at beginning of build')
  },
  onPreBuild: () => {
    console.log('Run custom logic before build happens')
  },
  onPostBuild: () => {
    console.log('Run custom logic after build happens')
  },
  onEnd: () => {
    console.log('Run custom logic at the end of the build')
  },
}
```

To use this plugin, define the `plugins` key in your Netlify config file.

```yml
build:
  functions: src/functions
  publish: build
  command: npm run build

# Netlify build plugins
plugins:
  # Path to plugin. Can be local relative path or reference to node_modules
  - package: netlify-plugin-awesome
    config:
      foo: hello
      bar: goodbye
```

Read the docs for
[more information on building plugins](https://github.com/netlify/build/blob/master/docs/creating-a-plugin.md)

The above example shows show to use `netlify.yml` with YAML syntax. It's also possible to keep using `toml`. Adding a
plugin in TOML looks like:

```toml
[[plugins]]
package = "./path/to/my-plugin.js"
```

## What can plugins do?

Plugins can do **a-lot** and we are excited what the JAMstack community will build!

Below are some areas where build plugins can help expands what is possible in site builds.

### 1. Optimizing build speeds & lowing cost

Using a smart build plugin, you can avoid & optimize expensive time consuming build processes.

This will help users avoid things like optimizing the same images every build, running builds when irrelevant
`README.md` files have changed, building site files when only serverless functions have changed etc.

By leveraging the [git](https://github.com/netlify/build/blob/master/packages/git-utils/README.md) and
[caching](https://github.com/netlify/build/blob/master/packages/cache-utils/README.md) utilities provided many things
are possible!

<details>
  <summary>Some plugin examples</summary>

  <br/>

Below is a list of things possible with Build plugins to get some ideas flowing

- **Gatsby cache plugin**
- **Cypress Route testing plugin** - Only running cypress tests on routes that have changed
- **Ignore site build scripts plugin** - Only run site build commands if site files have changed. Otherwise just build
  serverless functions.
- **Smart builds plugin** - Ignore site build if source files we change about, e.g. markdown/src directory's haven't
  changed
- **Check external content updates plugin** - Only build if external content from third party CMS has changed
- Optimize only new images **not** found in the previous build's cache folder
- Only build relevant sub directories that have changed & restore the rest of the site from previous build cache.
  Incremental builds?!?!?!
- Aggressively cache dependancies/generated files/etc for faster boot up times
- NoOp component library/Storybook builds if component src files haven't changed.
- Automatically disable builds during specific times of day.
- ... etc. Maybe options! 🤩

</details>

### 2. Standardize workflows & developer productivity

In today's age of JavaScript fatigue, setting up new projects & build tools is no easy feat. The amount of complexity
that comes with setting up a production build environment is non trivial & typically replicated over and over again for
projects.

Build plugins are designed to help streamline this flow & help growing teams move faster.

By abstracting common build tasks **up the stack**, this allows for plugins to be re-used in any type of project
regardless of the underlying framework or static site generator.

Plugins are meant to be shared within teams & in the broader JAMStack ecosystem. This enables developers & teams to
focus more time on building their app and less time on setting up the plumbing of a CI pipeline.

Some additional benefits we think will materialize out of standardizing these flows include:

- Improved security practices
- Increased compliance & accessibility
- Enforcing performance budgets
- Less time on-boarding new developers to the team
- Lower project maintenance
- Easier project scaffolding
- & ultimately shipping more awesome

<details>
  <summary>Some workflow plugin examples</summary>

  <br/>

Below is a list of things possible with Build plugins to get some ideas flowing

- **Company XYZ creates a plugin that encompasses performance, accessibility & security requirements for all their web
  properties**. This plugin uses various performance + accessibility regression testing tools and scans dependancies for
  critical vulnerabilities. This plugin also sends back build metrics to a centralized logging tool for further BI
  processing. This plugin is installed as a one liner in all Netlify projects.
- **A component tracking plugin** - This plugin scans the src code for components used from a component library & tracks
  which products are using which components, their versions, & other meta data. This helps inform the component library
  team what teams they need to coordinate with to safely test & release changes across the organization.
- **Analytics assurance plugin** - This plugin scans built output and verifies that every page on the site includes
  their google analytics tracking code & that the code is not malformed.
- **"SEO audit" plugin.** - This plugin scans built site to ensure all pages have required meta tags, properly formatted
  schema tags & social open graph tags. It also verifies the validity of the sitemap and submits the new sitemap to
  google webmaster tools when a new page is added to ensure a hasty indexation time.
- **404 no more plugin.** - This plugin guards against pages being removed & not having a proper redirect setup.
- **Lighthouse performance** - testing to guard against performance degradation.
- **Text linting plugins** This plugin would scan the built output of the site for common misspellings & brand keywords
  that need to be consistent across the product & cancel build or report these.
- **Saucelabs cross browser testing plugin** Automatically run deploy previews their every known browser to verify your
  app works across all browsers you support
- **"Self healing" deploy plugins.** - These plugins would detect a regression in a postDeployment hook and
  automatically report the issue & rollback the regression to a previous verified deployment.
- **"Canary deployments" plugin** - These plugins can use the A/B routing tool to gradually route traffic to the newly
  deployed version while "retiring" the previously deployed app if no error threshold is passed
- **Accessibility plugins** - to automatically audit site for accessibility issues
- **Image & asset optimization plugins** to automatically optimize site assets in a directory when the site is built to
  ensure optimal performance.
- **CSP (Content security policy) audit plugin** - This plugin checks the content security policy of the site & warns +
  enforces a secure policy to prevent cross script scripting attacks
- **Third party script + GDPR auditor plugin"** - This plugin scans the site for any third party script tags included,
  loads the page & reports the find output of scripts loaded on the page, the cookies/storage they produce & report +
  track them for the user. These values are increasingly important with GPDR & cookie consent laws.
- **Dependency scanner plugin** - A dependency scanner plugin to ensure no compromised dependencies are present.
- **Ingress/Egress Rules plugin** This plugin ensures that any http calls during the build process are to approved
  endpoints & not to malicious third party leaking secrets etc.
- **XSS payload injection plugin** This plugin runs post deployment & hammers form inputs with common XSS payloads to
  verify inputs & requests are properly sanitized.
- ... the sky is the limit 🌈

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END (COMMUNITY_PLUGINS) -->

To add a plugin, add information to the
[plugins.json file]('https://github.com/netlify/plugins/blob/master/plugins.json').

## CLI commands

Like [Netlify dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/), Netlify build runs locally and in the remote CI context

Install the [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli), if you haven't already.

```
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

To execute your build locally, run the following CLI command:

```
netlify build
```

It's also possible to "try before you buy" and test out the build flow before executing any code with the `dry` run
flag.

The `--dry` flag will output everything that happens in the build flow without executing the plugin event handlers.

To execute a test run of the build locally, run the following CLI command:

```
netlify build --dry
```
